Facial Expression Classification using TensorFlow/Keras
Overview:
This project involves classifying facial expressions from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) created with TensorFlow/Keras. The goal is to recognize various emotions in facial images by leveraging a specific dataset.

Project Structure:

Dataset: The project utilizes the ExpW dataset, comprising 91,793 images of diverse facial expressions like angry, surprised, and happy.

Images Location: Stored in /kaggle/input/origin-expw/origin.

Labels: Found in the label.lst file, which contains bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and expression labels.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.
Extract labels and bounding boxes.
Filter data based on confidence scores.
Data Augmentation:

Apply techniques to enhance model generalization.
Model Architecture:

Construct a CNN designed for image classification.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model on the dataset.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix.
Installation:
To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies using:

bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy opencv-python matplotlib  
How to Run:

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-classification.git  
cd facial-expression-classification  
Launch the Jupyter notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook facial-expression.ipynb  
Follow the notebook steps for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Model Architecture:
The CNN includes:

Convolutional Layers
Max Pooling Layers
Fully Connected Layers
Dropout layers for regularization
This design focuses on extracting spatial features from images.

Results:
Post-training, the model is assessed through:

Accuracy: Measures the rate of correctly classified expressions.
Confusion Matrix: Offers a visual representation of actual versus predicted classifications.
Dataset:
Contains labeled facial expression images and information on bounding box coordinates and confidence levels for detected faces. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, with data augmentation applied to enhance performance.
